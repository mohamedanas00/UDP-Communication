## UDP Communication

This Java code establishes a simple UDP communication between a client and a server. The client sends messages to the server, which in turn responds with another message. The communication occurs via User Datagram Protocol (UDP).

## Communication
- Enter messages in the client console. They will be sent to the server.
- The server receives and displays the messages from the client.
- After receiving a message, the server prompts for a response, which it sends back to the client.
- To end the communication, simply close the client or server console.

## Usage
1. Ensure the server is running before starting the client.
2. Run the serverUDP class to start the server.
3. Run the clientUDP class to start the client.
4. Follow the prompts in the client console to send messages to the server and receive responses.

## Notes
- Both client and server classes should be run on separate consoles or terminals.
- The server will continue running until explicitly terminated or encounters an error.
- This code provides a basic framework for UDP socket communication in Java and can be extended for more complex applications.
